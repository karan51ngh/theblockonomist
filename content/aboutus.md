***“Liberty, when it begins to take root, is a plant of rapid growth.”***  
***\- George Washington***

It was during the lockdown, when I started learning about how _CryptoCurrencies_ work, and that is how I discovered
the amazing concept of _Blockchain_ and _Decentralization_.
\
Decentralization diffuses power away from single centralized entities, empowering every person, so that he/she can participate in a **Freer and Fairer** system.
\
\
Through this Blog, I aim at sharing my knowledge of:
- **Blockchain** Technology
- **Austrian School of Economic Thought**
- **Cryptocurrencies**
- And other **programming and tech** related topics,

with you and hope to be able to impact your life in a possitive way.
\
\
Hope you have a plesant time reading my Blog,\
for it's all about **Liberty and Freedom!**
